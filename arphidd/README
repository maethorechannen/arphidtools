arphidd - an experimental "server" for RFID cards/tags

arphidd is a server for RFID reader events. It reads RFIDs from a reader and sends out signals via dbus.

At the moment, it only sends out a signal for when it has read a card.

It currently only supports 1 type of reader(ACS ACR 38U-CCID 00 00) and only 1 reader attached to the computer.

Currently, there is no install. Just run the arphidd.py script from the command line (it's still very experimental).
It will crash if a card reader is not attached (at least on my system).

It sits on top of pyscard, so that (and it's dependencies) will need to be installed. Ubuntu Jaunty has this in it's
repositories, but Ibex doesn't.
